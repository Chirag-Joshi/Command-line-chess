The Game :
I have developed a chess game which can be played via the command line. This game follows all the legal moves possible in a game of chess.

How to play : 
The game follows simple commands via the command line such as ‘a2a3’ i.e. to move the piece present at position a2 to position a3. Special moves such as castling can also be played through similar commands.

Features :
There are two variants of the game viz. 
	1) Two human players
	2) 1 human player and 1 computer player	
The game can be saved at any point of time and the saved game can again be played by loading it.
