I have done an implementation of the Chess game using the command line.
Currently, I have most of the pieces moving.
The next stage will be doing the end game conditions, being the check and draw functions.
Also, there will be a facility of saving the current game, opening it, making changes to it, deleting it.
The program uses an 8x8 integer array and prints the board and moves using this.
Simple commands like a2a3, a4g4, etc are used.
To start a new game, enter command 'new'.
Commands like save, delete, load will be implemented.
